        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Allana, and it's a pleasure to have you on this page. 
        <br>
        I am currently a junior in UH-Maui College's <a href="https://maui.hawaii.edu/programs/abit"> Business and IT (ABIT)</a> program, and works full-time as an Account Clerk for the 
        <a href="https://ag.hawaii.gov/hcjdc/">State of Hawaii Dept. of the Attorney General - Hawaii Criminal Justice Data Center.</a>
        </p>

        <p>My interests include watching anime, K- and J-dramas. I'm not the most athletic in town, but I had found that archery is something that helps me relax and have fun at the same time. I've also started getting into Pokemon cards because of my boyfriend (it all started with the cute cards). I don't cook much but I am learning to make my own healthy meals.</p>
