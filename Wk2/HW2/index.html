        do not include non-professional content!
        <p>My interests include watching anime, K- and J-dramas. I'm not the most athletic in town, but I had found that archery is something that helps me relax and have fun at the same time. I've also started getting into Pokemon cards because of my boyfriend (it all started with the cute cards). I don't cook much but I am learning to make my own healthy meals.</p>
